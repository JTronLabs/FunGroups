This project is my first stab at Android programming
The purpose is to create a studying tool for Organic Chemistry functional groups. 
There is an Activity to cycle through flash cards graphically, and Activity to create new groupings (or decks) of flash cards, and an Activity to practice 15 randomly chosen functional groups from the currently selected deck of flash cards.
Some things I included just for learning purposes. For example, this project did not require an SQLite DB (I could have stored the data in a different way), but I wanted to see how those operations would work within the Android Environment.
The code's not perfect so don't expect it to be. In the future I would like to improve/expand upon the comments.
