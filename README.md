<p>This project is my first stab at Android programming</p></br>
<p>The purpose is to create a studying tool for Organic Chemistry functional groups. </p></br>
<p>There is an Activity to cycle through flash cards graphically, an Activity to create new groupings (or decks) of flash cards, and a practice quiz Activity (uses current deck of flash cards)</p></br>
<p>Some things I included just for learning purposes. For example, this project did not require an SQLite DB (I could have stored the data in a different way), but I wanted to see how those operations would work within the Android Environment.</p></br>
<p>The code's not perfect so don't expect it to be. In the future I would like to improve/expand upon the comments. Thanks for visiting!</p></br>
