<h1>Fun Groups</h1>
<p>This project was my first stab at Android programming. The purpose was to create a studying tool for O. Chem functional groups (what is a functional group? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group) </p></br>
<p>In this app the user can cycle through flash cards, create new groupings (or decks) of flash cards, and complete a practice quiz using the current deck of flash cards. There is a predefined list of ~92 functional groups that can be possibly viewed. All images I created using Chem Draw (https://www.cambridgesoft.com/Ensemble_for_Chemistry/ChemDraw/). </p></br>
<p>I had a blast working on this project, if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement shoot me an email!</p></br>
<p>Thanks for visiting!</p></br>
